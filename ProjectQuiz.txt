What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

Content delivery networks use multiple servers in many geographic locations that improve deliveries of static and streaming content. CDNs minimize latency issues that cause image jitters and optimize delivery speeds.
Four advantages of using CDN:
1. Faster Loading: Internet speeds improve and faster load times mean higher sales for companies
2. Control heavy traffic and buffering: CDNs help to deliver better user experiences when downloading video and audio content.This leads to a decrease in lags and buffers.
3. Scalability: large CDNs can handle new material as companies expand their online presences.
4. Enable Linear Networks: Companies can broadcast in the same way that major networks do, creating their own program schedules for 24-hour CDN deliveries around the world.
